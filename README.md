# Wyverns-Necessities
A personal Terraria mod focused on fixing issues I have with the game.
The goal of this mod is to add various things I feel like would make the game overall a more enjoyable and less tedious process, while simutaneously adding things I want like vanity to the game. This mod in no way is meant to be super serious, but I want it to be reasonable for it to exist in modded playthroughs.
